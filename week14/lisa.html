                <li>The Khan family dog grooming business dates back to 1908, when NYC immigrant Harsha Khan
                    offered to bathe his neighbors' dogs for $5/bath. Harsha taught his techniques to his son, Sundar, who passed them onto
                    Prakesh, owner and CEO of A Dog's Life! That's three generations of canine-obsessed entrepreneurs.
